## Prompt

check specs for these points also does specs follow it or is there anything needed to update it. A good spec has:

✅ Crystal-clear intent (no ambiguity)
✅ Explicit constraints (no surprises during planning)
✅ Measurable success criteria (AI can build acceptance tests from them)
✅ Constitution alignment (specification respects Constitution standards)

## Response snapshot

The `spec.md` successfully adheres to all four specified criteria: crystal-clear intent, explicit constraints, measurable success criteria, and Constitution alignment. No updates are needed at this time.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Validated the quality of the feature specification against user-defined criteria, confirming its readiness for further stages.
- 🧪 Tests: No formal tests were run; a manual review was performed.
- 📁 Files: Read `specs/001-textbook-ai-robotics/spec.md` and `D:\AI-Hackathon\ai-book with claude\book_claude\.specify\memory\constitution.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now proceed with planning or implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully performed a comprehensive review and provided a clear assessment, demonstrating adherence to quality standards.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: null
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
