# Module 2: Introduction to Digital Twins

## Overview

**Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** introduces you to physics simulation and environment building for robots. Digital twins allow you to test and develop robotic systems in virtual environments before deploying to physical hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand physics simulation principles
- Master Gazebo for robot simulation
- Learn Unity for high-fidelity rendering
- Simulate sensors: LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Build realistic environments for robot testing

## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual representation of a physical system that:

- Mirrors the physical robot's structure and behavior
- Simulates physics, sensors, and actuators
- Enables testing without physical hardware
- Provides safe environment for experimentation

## Why Use Simulation?

1. **Cost-effective**: No need for expensive hardware during development
2. **Safe**: Test dangerous scenarios without risk
3. **Repeatable**: Consistent test conditions
4. **Scalable**: Run multiple simulations in parallel
5. **Fast iteration**: Quick testing cycles

## Module Structure

This module covers:

1. **Gazebo Simulation** - Physics-based robot simulation
2. **Unity Rendering** - High-fidelity visualization
3. **Sensor Simulation** - LiDAR, cameras, IMUs

## Next Steps

Proceed to [Gazebo Simulation](/module2/gazebo-simulation) to start building your digital twin.
