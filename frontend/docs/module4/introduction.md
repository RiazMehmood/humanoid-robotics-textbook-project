# Module 4: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action

## Overview

**Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** explores the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics, enabling robots to understand natural language commands and translate them into actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand Vision-Language-Action architectures
- Implement voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper
- Use LLMs for cognitive planning
- Build an autonomous humanoid robot system
- Complete a capstone project

## What is VLA?

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** combines:

- **Vision**: Visual perception of the environment
- **Language**: Natural language understanding
- **Action**: Physical robot control

This enables robots to:

- Understand spoken commands
- Plan complex tasks from natural language
- Execute actions based on high-level instructions

## Module Structure

This module covers:

1. **Voice-to-Action** - Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
2. **Cognitive Planning** - LLM-based task planning
3. **Capstone Project** - Autonomous humanoid system

## Next Steps

Proceed to [Voice-to-Action](/module4/voice-to-action) to start with voice command processing.
