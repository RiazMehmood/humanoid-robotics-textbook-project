# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook! This course bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, teaching you how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You will learn to work with cutting-edge tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac to create intelligent robotic systems.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:

- **Share our physical form**: They can navigate and interact in environments designed for humans
- **Learn from human data**: Abundant data from human interactions can train these systems
- **Enable natural interaction**: Their human-like form facilitates intuitive communication

This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- ✅ Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- ✅ Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- ✅ Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- ✅ Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- ✅ Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- ✅ Integrate LLMs for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four main modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the middleware that enables robot control, including ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and how to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Explore physics simulation and environment building, including high-fidelity rendering and sensor simulation.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Master advanced perception and training using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated navigation.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Discover the convergence of LLMs and robotics, from voice commands to cognitive planning and autonomous humanoid control.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
